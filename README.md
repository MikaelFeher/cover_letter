Dear Hiring Manager!

I am hereby applying for the position of Junior Web Developer.

As a recent graduate of a coding bootcamp, this will be my first step towards a professional career
as a software developer. Although not having worked in development outside the bootcamp. I did however, 
towards the end of the bootcamp, get involved in Craft Academy Labs, where I participated on a project 
for a paying client. It was a booking application for a conference facility.

Technically I am a Ruby on Rails developer with secondary skills in JavaScript, but I consider my self a programmer/developer first and the languages I use merely as tools of the trade. That being said I really
like Ruby, and the beauty of simplicity.  Simplicity is what I strive for in all aspects of my life, both 
professionally as well as personally. A big and/or complex issue has just not been broken down into small 
enough pieces yet. This does however not mean that I shy away from "tough" or "hard" issues, I am a problem 
solver at heart, which probably is the reason why I love software development. I also love challenges, which
is why I felt right at home in the bootcamp, 12 weeks of nonÂ­stop challenges.


**So what did I learn in the bootcamp, apart from the obvious coding skills?**

I learned how to acquire knowledge and skills fast. I discovered that I am passionate about
coding, passionate about learning more and getting better. My goal for the bootcamp was to be the best developer
I can be, simply to be better today then I was yesterday and better tomorrow than I am today.


**Why hire me?**
**39 years old and just starting out in software development you say?**

Well, I have tried several different fields before I got bit by the coding bug; I have worked in healthcare, 
security and on the railroad. It took me this long and that many tries to find my calling in life, I love coding. 
If my way into the industry is indicative in any way, then it is that I can handle challenges, that I am passionate about coding, that I am a fast learner, that I can acquire knowledge needed to get the job done. I strive to get the job done:
"Pretty code is good, working code is better!"
